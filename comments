What you have so far looks as if it is on the correct track coinciding with the UNIX philosophy. Remember to keep certain points in mind as you continue through your coding: small is beautiful, store data in flat text files, and use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability. I love the idea of the Monopoly game though! Great job.
